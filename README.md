#some-new-repo

##Website for creating todos (tasks) with authorization.

Implemented all requests for CRUD technology. The authorized user has the
ability to create, edit, mark tasks when they are completed, and also delete
them. There is a search for tasks by date of their creation (also near the
search by date there is a button to return to all tasks for all dates), as well
there is a search by name (also near the search there is a search clear button).
The user can sort the tasks by status - completed or not, or select all tasks.
There is a sort in alphabetical order, in reverse order and by default.
Pagination occurs when there are more than 4 tasks.

Used libraries and technologies: React | React Hooks | React Hook Form | React
Router | Code Splitting | Redux | Redux persist | Redux Toolkit | SCSS modules |
Axios | Material UI | Debounce
