## Website for creating todos (tasks) with authorization.

* Implemented all requests for CRUD technology. 
* The authorized user has the ability to create, edit, mark tasks when they are completed, and also delete them. 
* There is a search for tasks by date of their creation (also near the search by date there is a button to return to all tasks for all dates), as well
there is a search by name (also near the search there is a search clear button).
* The user can sort the tasks by status - completed or not, or select all tasks.
* There is a sort in alphabetical order, in reverse order and by default.
* Pagination occurs when there are more than 4 tasks.
